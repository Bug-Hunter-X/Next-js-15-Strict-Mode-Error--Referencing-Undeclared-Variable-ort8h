# Next.js 15 Strict Mode Error: Undeclared Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when upgrading to Next.js 15 due to its stricter mode.  The issue arises from referencing an undeclared variable within a page component. This results in a runtime error that can be challenging to track down.

## The Problem

Next.js 15's strict mode enforces stricter JavaScript rules, leading to errors if you try to use variables that haven't been declared. In the `pages/about.js` file, the line `console.log(a);` attempts to log a variable 'a' without declaring it. This is valid in non-strict mode but throws an error in Next 15's strict mode. 

## The Solution

The solution is to ensure all variables are properly declared before use.  The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code with the variable 'a' properly declared and initialized (although its value is not really used in the context).

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the error in the console and the updated behavior after you modify `pages/about.js` with the code from `pages/aboutSolution.js`.
